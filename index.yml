title: Neurocritical Care Predictor
author: Zack Goldblum, Josh Miller, Kevin Ramirez Chavez
abstract: Patients with severe neurological and neurosurgical conditions are treated at 
  Neurocritical Intensive Care Units. These patients present a combination of unique 
  conditions that make it difficult for the physician to provide an accurate treatment 
  pathway, resulting in a higher mortality risk for the patient. The purpose of this project 
  is to provide physicians with a tool for predicting the outcome for a new patient. This 
  GUI-based tool compares the patient information entered by the clinician to a database of 
  previous patients and determines the mortality risk for the current patient.
